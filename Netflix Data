/*I wrote this code to query a database of some Netflix data to answer some questions.*/

--Join the two tables and show some information about them.
SELECT people.show_id, people.director, titles.title, titles.rating 
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    ON people.show_id = titles.show_id;

--1. How many movies are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT count(titles.type) 
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    WHERE titles.type = 'Movie';

--2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT titles.date_added
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    GROUP BY titles.date_added
    ORDER BY titles.date_added desc
    limit 2;

--3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT titles.title
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    ORDER BY titles.title;

--4. Who was the director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT people.director
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
    WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

--5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT titles.title, titles.release_year
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    WHERE titles.type = 'Movie'
    ORDER BY titles.release_year asc
    limit 1;
